# Spring Boot - HTTP / Front and Back End

In this repository, I developed a Spring Boot project that includes the following technologies:

### Technologies Used:
- **Java (Version 21)**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **CSS (Styling)**  
- **JSP (Java Server Pages)**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Hibernate**
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**
- **H2 DataBase**

### About the Project:
This project provides a graphical user interface to validate HTTP requests from the **Front End** and return responses as defined by the **Back End**. The following HTTP methods are available in the application:

- **GET**
- **POST**
- **GET/{id}**
- **PATCH/{id}**
- **DELETE/{id}**

### Note:
Currently, I am learning how to use JavaScript. The requests to the Back End were written with pure JavaScript, while the Back End logic for handling these requests was developed by me using **Java**.
